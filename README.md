# React Weather App

This is a simple React app that displays the current weather of a given location. For the icons and weather information I used the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API. 

# Usage

Just download the file, open a command prompt in the files directory and type "npm start". Your browser will automatically open and direct you to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), where the app will be run in development mode.
